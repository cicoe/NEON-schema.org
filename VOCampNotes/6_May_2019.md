Short Recap:
- Ended last session with following TODOS
 - @Christine: select refine data set selection by: simple, ‘mature vocab’, available scientists for next session initial exercise to explore competency questions.  
n’t have time this past week
 - Examples evolving here: https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/tree/master/examples
- Potentials:
    - Single aspirated air temperature: https://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.00002.001]
    - Ground beetles sampled from pitfall traps: https://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.10022.001
    - Plant presence and percent cover: https://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.10058.001

- @Jeremy: integrate #NEON into portal
- gress on a development server https://cert-data.neonscience.org

## Today
URI discussion: (http range14) needing resolving for science on schema.  In short: how to name things that are not bytes.  

Also of relevance is the SELFIE project:https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/selfie
Kicked off last week.

Christine discussion: do we have a schema.org dereferencable jsonld response for each data product? (in addition to the main pages)
- Chuck: Yes, what should the best default response be - likely license + description
  - Step1: Competency questions
- Competency questions:  Comes from DB world. If you’re asking a Q of a question, ensure the data is structured in a way that facilitates querying the data for that question.  ~ 20Qs you might ask of the data. Ideally for ontologies you want a ‘deep’ model. Schema.org as a vocab is ‘shallow’ 

### Possible Example Data Sets
    1. Single aspirated air temperature: https://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.00002.001
    2. Ground beetles sampled from pitfall traps: https://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.10022.001
    3. Plant presence and percent cover: https://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.10058.001

#### Set A
Step1: What Qs would a scientists ask when searching for set A.  These are about discoverability - dataset search
1. Air temperature data in <geospatial bounding box>
    - Co-ordinates/region/Ecotype/NEON name
2. Air temperature data in <atmosphere/ground>
3. Air temp  in <date range>
    - Date range could be days/months/years
4. Air temperature and <other associated data>
    - Eg: Ground temperature
5. Temperature profile / Heat flux / Energy curve/microclimate
6. By <instrument/method> 
    - Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT)
7. By <site> 
    - Search for other data related to the same site but not served by the same provider - collected by other organisations

#### SetB
https://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.10022.001
1. Beetles/Carabidae  <geospatial range> <Date range>
2. By taxonomic hierarchy (Up or down tree)
3. <Method>: Pitfall traps / bycatch 
4. Insects / biodiversity / genetic diversity
5. If physical samples are available
6. By location
7. Closely related datasets
8. Invasive/indigenous species
9. Endangered status

Determined not of interest:
1. By frequency of sampling
2. Conditions

#### SetC:
https://data.neonscience.org/data-product-view?dpCode=DP1.10058.001
1. Species
    1. Taxonomy
    2. Also: By vegetative structure (eg woody vs grasses): 
2. Cover type (National Land Cover DB - from ENVO)
3. Method of sample
4. Location/Site/Biome/Habitat
    1. Heat zone
5. Date range - particularly important for this as season is highly indicative
    1. Search by month/week/season name/
    2. Search by ‘disturbance:  eg After frost/fire, during growing seasons (but this isn’t in the data so would be by proxy of date)
6. Percentage cover?

Determined not likely of interest:
- Resolution of samples

### Unique to a set Competency Questions
SetA: Air temp
SetB: Beetles
    - Physical samples
    - Endangered status
    - Invasive/Indigenous
###Common Competency Questions
- Site/location
- Time range
- Method/Instrument type
- Associated data
- Other/associated terms
- Sample hierarchical terminology (taxomic/

###Site naming discussion
Currently named: 
- 4 letter site codes
- Also domain numbers/names: 20 NEON domains
- Not correlated with USGS GENIS naming

###Google Data Search Currently
- JPL and others exploring the use of ‘actions’ //Where queries are handed off from 1 search engine to another.  Eg google search ‘action’ hands off to a JPL specific search engine
- Currently only appears to parse titles - eg doesn’t let you refine the search by date
- Is parsing data ‘description’

###Future steps
Vocabularies are in EML so mapping work has been done
Ideal: Full stack demo of 1 dataset
Start with these 3 
Minimal 1st step: Model the sites issue
Airborne has some effort of description: tables

###Immediate next step:
    1. Data set description (per science on schema as stands now)
        1. Leads to see how well that supports above competency questions = next steps
    2. Site description in LD model: Probably more likely a collaborative effort to propose to ESIP.  Start with VOCamps (eg Polar data effort). Pick a NEON site as the driver
